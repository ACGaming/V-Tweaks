1.4.3:
-Added: Ability to edit signs via shift R-click with empty hand
-Added: Placement sound for doors (now all sound fixes are generalized in the config)
-Added: Fix for Light / Heavy Pressure Plate step sounds (see above for config info)
-Changed: Great optimizations to Easy Crop Harvesting drops
-Changed: Torch + Tool interaction now supports any item in your inventory with the localized version of 
	the name "Torch" - this offers multilingual support, so if your language it isn't named "Torch", 
	it'll still work
-Changed: Crop Harvesting now requires an empty hand to activate - temporary fix for weirdness with
	right-click interaction with your currently equipped item
-Fixed: Nether Wart "bonemealing" tweak allowing you to waste blaze powder on a fully grown crop

1.4:
-Changed: Completely rewrote configuration file and in-game mod config. All settings will need to be re-changed.
-Changed: Many small internal refactors. Affects nothing.
-Added: Ability to disable Lightning (or technically, thunderstorms). Lightning on my server causes a lot of stupidity.
-Added: (1.8.8 only) Ability to change Anvil placement sound to the same as a metal block
