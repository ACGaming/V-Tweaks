1.4:
-Changed: Completely rewrote configuration file and in-game mod config. All settings will need to be re-changed.
-Changed: Many small internal refactors. Affects nothing.
-Added: Ability to disable Lightning (or technically, thunderstorms). Lightning on my server causes a lot of stupidity.
-Added: (1.8.8 only) Ability to change Anvil placement sound to the same as a metal block
